Kubeconform is a Kubernetes manifests validation tool. Build it into your CI to validate your Kubernetes
configuration!

It is inspired by, contains code from and is designed to stay close to
[Kubeval](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubeval), but with the following improvements:
 * **high performance**: will validate & download manifests over multiple routines, caching
   downloaded files in memory
 * configurable list of **remote, or local schemas locations**, enabling validating Kubernetes
   custom resources (CRDs) and offline validation capabilities
 * uses by default a [self-updating fork](https://github.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema) of the schemas registry maintained
   by the kubernetes-json-schema project - which guarantees
   up-to-date **schemas for all recent versions of Kubernetes**.

### A small overview of Kubernetes manifest validation

Kubernetes's API is described using the [OpenAPI (formerly swagger) specification](https://www.openapis.org),
in a [file](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json) checked into
the main Kubernetes repository.

Because of the state of the tooling to perform validation against OpenAPI schemas, projects usually convert
the OpenAPI schemas to [JSON schemas](https://json-schema.org/) first. Kubeval relies on
[instrumenta/OpenApi2JsonSchema](https://github.com/instrumenta/openapi2jsonschema) to convert Kubernetes' Swagger file
and break it down into multiple JSON schemas, stored in github at
[instrumenta/kubernetes-json-schema](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubernetes-json-schema) and published on
[kubernetesjsonschema.dev](https://kubernetesjsonschema.dev/).

Kubeconform relies on [a fork of kubernetes-json-schema](https://github.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema/)
that is more aggressively kept up-to-date, and contains schemas for all recent versions of Kubernetes.

### Limits of Kubeconform validation

Kubeconform, similarly to kubeval, only validates manifests using the OpenAPI specifications. In some
cases, the Kubernetes controllers might perform additional validation - so that manifests passing kubeval
validation would still error when being deployed. See for example these bugs against kubeval:
[#253](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubeval/issues/253)
[#256](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubeval/issues/256)
[#257](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubeval/issues/257)
[#259](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubeval/issues/259). The validation logic mentioned in these
bug reports is not part of Kubernetes' OpenAPI spec, and therefore kubeconform/kubeval will not detect the
configuration errors.

### Installation

If you are a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) user, you can install by running:

```bash
$ brew install kubeconform
```

You can also download the latest version from the [release page](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/releases).

Another way of installation is via Golang's package manager:

```bash
# With a specific version tag
$ go install github.com/yannh/kubeconform/cmd/kubeconform@v0.4.13

# Latest version
$ go install github.com/yannh/kubeconform/cmd/kubeconform@latest
```

### Usage examples

* Validating a single, valid file
```
$ ./bin/kubeconform fixtures/valid.yaml
$ echo $?
0
```

* Validating a single invalid file, setting output to json, and printing a summary
```
$ ./bin/kubeconform -summary -output json fixtures/invalid.yaml
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "filename": "fixtures/invalid.yaml",
      "kind": "ReplicationController",
      "version": "v1",
      "status": "INVALID",
      "msg": "Additional property templates is not allowed - Invalid type. Expected: [integer,null], given: string"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "valid": 0,
    "invalid": 1,
    "errors": 0,
    "skipped": 0
  }
}
$ echo $?
1
```

* Passing manifests via Stdin
```
cat fixtures/valid.yaml  | ./bin/kubeconform -summary
Summary: 1 resource found parsing stdin - Valid: 1, Invalid: 0, Errors: 0 Skipped: 0
```

* Validating a folder, increasing the number of parallel workers
```
$ ./bin/kubeconform -summary -n 16 fixtures
fixtures/crd_schema.yaml - CustomResourceDefinition trainingjobs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com failed validation: could not find schema for CustomResourceDefinition
fixtures/invalid.yaml - ReplicationController bob is invalid: Invalid type. Expected: [integer,null], given: string
[...]
Summary: 65 resources found in 34 files - Valid: 55, Invalid: 2, Errors: 8 Skipped: 0
```

### Overriding schemas location - CRD and Openshift support

When the `-schema-location` parameter is not used, or set to "default", kubeconform will default to downloading
schemas from `https://github.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema`. Kubeconform however supports passing one, or multiple,
schemas locations - HTTP(s) URLs, or local filesystem paths, in which case it will lookup for schema definitions
in each of them, in order, stopping as soon as a matching file is found.

 * If the -schema-location value does not end with '.json', Kubeconform will assume filenames / a file
 structure identical to that of kubernetesjsonschema.dev or github.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema.
 * if the -schema-location value ends with '.json' - Kubeconform assumes the value is a Go templated
 string that indicates how to search for JSON schemas.
* the -schema-location value of "default" is an alias for https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema/master/{{ .NormalizedKubernetesVersion }}-standalone{{ .StrictSuffix }}/{{ .ResourceKind }}{{ .KindSuffix }}.json.
Both following command lines are equivalent:
```
$ ./bin/kubeconform fixtures/valid.yaml
$ ./bin/kubeconform -schema-location default fixtures/valid.yaml
$ ./bin/kubeconform -schema-location 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema/master/{{ .NormalizedKubernetesVersion }}-standalone{{ .StrictSuffix }}/{{ .ResourceKind }}{{ .KindSuffix }}.json' fixtures/valid.yaml
```

To support validating CRDs, we need to convert OpenAPI files to JSON schema, storing the JSON schemas
in a local folder - for example schemas. Then we specify this folder as an additional registry to lookup:

```
# If the resource Kind is not found in kubernetesjsonschema.dev, also lookup in the schemas/ folder for a matching file
$ ./bin/kubeconform -schema-location default -schema-location 'schemas/{{ .ResourceKind }}{{ .KindSuffix }}.json' fixtures/custom-resource.yaml
```

You can validate Openshift manifests using a custom schema location. Set the OpenShift version to validate
against using -kubernetes-version.

```
bin/kubeconform -kubernetes-version 3.8.0  -schema-location 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garethr/openshift-json-schema/master/{{ .NormalizedKubernetesVersion }}-standalone{{ .StrictSuffix }}/{{ .ResourceKind }}.json'  -summary fixtures/valid.yaml
Summary: 1 resource found in 1 file - Valid: 1, Invalid: 0, Errors: 0 Skipped: 0
```

Here are the variables you can use in -schema-location:
 * *NormalizedKubernetesVersion* - Kubernetes Version, prefixed by v
 * *StrictSuffix* - "-strict" or "" depending on whether validation is running in strict mode or not
 * *ResourceKind* - Kind of the Kubernetes Resource
 * *ResourceAPIVersion* - Version of API used for the resource - "v1" in "apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1"
 * *Group* - the group name as stated in this resource's definition - "monitoring.coreos.com" in "apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1"
 * *KindSuffix* - suffix computed from apiVersion - for compatibility with Kubeval schema registries

### Converting an OpenAPI file to a JSON Schema

Kubeconform uses JSON schemas to validate Kubernetes resources. For Custom Resource, the CustomResourceDefinition
first needs to be converted to JSON Schema. A script is provided to convert these CustomResourceDefinitions
to JSON schema. Here is an example how to use it:

```
$ ./scripts/openapi2jsonschema.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s/master/config/crd/bases/sagemaker.aws.amazon.com_trainingjobs.yaml
JSON schema written to trainingjob_v1.json
```

The `FILENAME_FORMAT` environment variable can be used to change the output file name (Available variables: `kind`, `group`, `version`) (Default: `{kind}_{version}`).

```
$ export FILENAME_FORMAT='{kind}-{group}-{version}'
$ ./scripts/openapi2jsonschema.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s/master/config/crd/bases/sagemaker.aws.amazon.com_trainingjobs.yaml
JSON schema written to trainingjob-sagemaker-v1.json
```

Some CRD schemas do not have explicit validation for fields implicitly validated by the Kubernetes API like `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata`, thus additional properties are allowed at the root of the JSON schema by default, if this is not desired the `DENY_ROOT_ADDITIONAL_PROPERTIES` environment variable can be set to any non-empty value.

### Usage as a Github Action

Kubeconform publishes Docker Images to Github's new Container Registry, ghcr.io. These images
can be used directly in a Github Action, once logged in using a [_Github Token_](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-03-24-packages-container-registry-now-supports-github_token/).

Example:
```
name: kubeconform
on: push
jobs:
  kubeconform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: login to Github Packages
        run: echo "${{ github.token }}" | docker login https://ghcr.io -u ${GITHUB_ACTOR} --password-stdin
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: docker://ghcr.io/yannh/kubeconform:master
        with:
          entrypoint: '/kubeconform'
          args: "-summary -output json kubeconfigs/"
```

_Note on pricing_: Kubeconform relies on Github Container Registry which is currently in Beta. During that period,
[bandwidth is free](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/about-github-container-registry). After that period,
bandwidth costs might be applicable. Since bandwidth from Github Packages within Github Actions is free, I expect
Github Container Registry to also be usable for free within Github Actions in the future. If that were not to be the
case, I might publish the Docker image to a different platform.

### Proxy support

Kubeconform will respect the HTTPS_PROXY variable when downloading schema files.

```
$ HTTPS_PROXY=proxy.local bin/kubeconform fixtures/valid.yaml
```
### Speed comparison with Kubeval

Running on a pretty large kubeconfigs setup, on a laptop with 4 cores:

```
$ time kubeconform -ignore-missing-schemas -n 8 -summary  preview staging production
Summary: 50714 resources found in 35139 files - Valid: 27334, Invalid: 0, Errors: 0 Skipped: 23380

real	0m6,710s
user	0m38,701s
sys	0m1,161s

$ time kubeval -d preview,staging,production --ignore-missing-schemas --quiet
[... Skipping output]

real	0m35,336s
user	0m0,717s
sys	0m1,069s

```

### Using kubeconform as a Go Module

**Warning**: This is a work-in-progress, the interface is not yet considered stable. Feedback is encouraged.

Kubeconform contains a package that can be used as a library.
An example of usage can be found in [examples/main.go](examples/main.go)
